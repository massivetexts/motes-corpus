       "\"Coming this summer. They're finally going to make a movie about me! The story of Batman's greatest ally. That's me. That must be me! And best friend in the whole world. Finally! Alfred: The Movie. It's time to clean up this city. - That actually does look pretty good. - I'd go see it. ♪  Just a young gun with a quick fuse ♪ They're really making movies about every superhero. Has there been a movie about you? There was a Green Lantern movie. But we don't talk about that. It's time they make one about me. I'm afraid it's no. I only make movies about real super heroes. [laughter] ♪  Dreaming 'bout being a big star ♪ Why don't they take us seriously? Titans, you guys are never actually doing anything heroic. What about that time we discovered that sweet diner? And they had that food! - Oh yeah. - Oh, yes. That wasn't even a crime and you didn't save anything. We saved room for dessert! Oh! Right in your face! ♪  Thunder! ♪ Having a movie is the only way to be seen as a real hero. What about an archnemesis? ♪  Thunder, feel the thunder ♪ ♪  Lightning and the thunder ♪ Stop right there. Deadpool? Deadpool? What? Why does everybody think I'm Deadpool? I thought Deadpool was a good guy. By the way, he should be saying that he's not me. Okay, 'cause I came out like way before he did. Nah, I'm pretty sure you're Deadpool. I am Slade! If we can make him our arch nemesis, then they will see that we're worthy of a movie. I'm not interested in fighting a bunch of sidekicks and a half a robot. Aw man! I'm never letting you fly my body again! The whole world will be under my control! [gasps] Destroy them! ♪  How big is your army? 100,000 ♪ Halt for the mighty Atom-- [grunt] ♪  Watch me! Watch me! Watch me do this ♪ ♪  It's always been more than the music ♪ ♪  You riding waves in the back of my cruise ship ♪ ♪  Look watch me, watch me ♪ Kitties! We're taking you down! How are you gonna do it? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna fart on me? You want to have a dance off? You gonna annoy me to death with your waffles? ♪  Hey! ♪\""
